    "## Task Management System Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Task Management System** is a Python application designed to facilitate efficient tracking and management of tasks. It utilizes file handling to store task data persistently in `taskfile.txt` and includes basic exception handling for error management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add Task:** Add new tasks with unique IDs, descriptions, statuses, and deadlines.\n",
    "- **Search Task:** Find and display task details by task ID.\n",
    "- **Update Task Status:** Modify task status (e.g., to-do, in progress, done) based on task ID.\n",
    "- **Delete Task:** Remove tasks from the system by task ID.\n",
    "- **Display Tasks:** Show all tasks with details including description, status, and deadline.\n",
    "- **Simulation Mode:** Simulate task operations without user input for testing purposes.\n",
    "- **Data Persistence:** Ensure task data is saved and loaded from `tasks.txt`.\n",
    "- **Error Handling:** Manage file-related errors and task operations exceptions.\n",
