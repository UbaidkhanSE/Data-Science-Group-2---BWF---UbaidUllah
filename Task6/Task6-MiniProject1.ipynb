    "## Student Management System Summary\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The <span style=\"color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;\">Student Management System</span> is a Python application designed to efficiently manage student records. It leverages file handling to store data persistently in `StudentData.txt` and incorporates robust exception handling to handle errors gracefully. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Key Features:\r\n",
    "- **Add:** Add new student records ensuring each student ID is unique.\r\n",
    "- **Search:** Find and display student records by student ID.\r\n",
    "- **Update:** Modify existing student information based on student ID.\r\n",
    "- **Delete:** Remove student records by student ID.\r\n",
    "- **Sort:** Arrange student records alphabetically by name or numerically by ID.\r\n",
    "- **Display:** View all student records with details including age and grades.\r\n",
    "- **Analytics:** Calculate average grades and count total number of effectively.\r\n"
